description: >
  OpenGUI is an open-source Electron desktop application that provides a rich graphical interface
  for OpenCode. It connects to multiple project directories simultaneously, letting you manage
  separate AI sessions per project. Responses stream in real-time via SSE with live token and
  context usage tracking. A built-in prompt queue lets you stack messages while the assistant is
  busy, automatically dispatching them when idle. Switch between AI providers, models, agents,
  and model variants on the fly, use slash commands, manage MCP servers and skills, and optionally
  dictate prompts via speech-to-text. Code blocks are syntax-highlighted with Shiki, math
  expressions render via KaTeX, and the UI supports both dark and light themes. Builds as .deb
  for Linux and .dmg for macOS.
