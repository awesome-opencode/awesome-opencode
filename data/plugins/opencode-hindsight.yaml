tagline: Retrospective learning agent - learns from session mistakes to prevent future errors
description: |
  Hindsight is a unique plugin that makes OpenCode smarter through retrospective learning.
  Unlike memory plugins that just store facts, Hindsight actively learns from errors, 
  failed commands, and self-corrections during your session. It builds a pattern database 
  of "what went wrong and why" and injects learned prevention rules into future prompts, 
  helping OpenCode avoid repeating the same mistakes. Features include: automatic error 
  detection and analysis, self-correction tracking, prevention hint injection, and 
  session statistics for insights into learning progress.
