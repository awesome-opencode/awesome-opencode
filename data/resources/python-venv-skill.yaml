tagline: Enforce Python virtual environment usage for third-party packages
description: |
  A skill that enforces Python virtual environment usage when installing packages or running scripts requiring third-party dependencies.

  ## Key Features
  - **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds existing venvs (.venv, venv, env, .env)
  - **Smart reuse**: Reuses existing environments instead of creating duplicates
  - **uv priority**: Uses uv for fast operations, falls back to python3 -m venv
  - **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and WSL
  - **Conda/Mamba support**: Detects and uses conda environments when available
  - **Project detection**: Recognizes uv.lock, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, Poetry, Pipfile
  - **Troubleshooting guide**: Helps solve common venv issues
  - **Safe enforcement**: Only enforces venv for third-party packages, skips stdlib-only code

  ## Usage
  Simply install the skill and it will automatically activate when you use Python or pip commands with third-party packages:

  ```bash
  # Run Python script with dependencies (automatic venv creation)
  "Run script.py that uses pandas and numpy"

  # Install packages (within venv)
  "Install requests and beautifulsoup4"

  # Standard library only (skips venv)
  "Print hello world"  # No venv created
  ```

  Perfect for Python development projects, data science workflows, and any codebase requiring third-party dependencies.
